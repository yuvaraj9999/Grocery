   DESCRIPTION
   ===========
   BundleTransformer.SassAndScss contains one translator-adapter -
   `SassAndScssTranslator`. This adapter makes translation of Sass and SCSS code to
   CSS code by using the LibSass Host for .NET 
   (https://github.com/Taritsyn/LibSassHost) version 1.2.6 (supports the LibSass
   (http://sass-lang.com/libsass) version 3.6.1). Also contains the
   `SassAndScssAssetHandler` debugging HTTP handler, which is responsible for text
   output of translated Sass or SCSS asset.

   This package does not contain the native implementations of LibSass for Windows.
   Therefore, you need to choose and install the most appropriate package(s) for
   your platform. The following packages are available:

    * LibSassHost.Native.win-x86
    * LibSassHost.Native.win-x64
